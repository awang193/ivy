# Ivy

A simple todo list based on the Ivy Lee method. A project for me to familiarize myself with React hooks and CSS. Still a WIP! In the future I plan on using this as a fully-featured todo list, but there's still a ways to go.

### List of features to implement

1. ~~Todo list functionality~~
2. ~~Basic styling~~
3. Animations and responsive resizing of components
4. Storing and measuring progress
